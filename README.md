# 🏀 Score Counter App (Flutter)

This is my **second Flutter app**, where I practiced using `StatefulWidget`, buttons, layout widgets, and state management using `setState()`.

## 📱 App Overview

The app simulates a **scoreboard** for two teams (Team A and Team B), allowing you to:
- Add 1, 2, or 3 points to either team.
- Reset both teams' scores to 0.
- Display the current score dynamically.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project was to learn:

- 🟠 `StatefulWidget` vs `StatelessWidget`
- 🟠 How to update UI dynamically using `setState()`
- 🟠 Structuring layout with `Row`, `Column`, and `Container`
- 🟠 Styling buttons with `ElevatedButton.styleFrom()`
- 🟠 Using `VerticalDivider` for visual separation
